# LangChain-101-Semantic-Search-of-Custom-PDF

This notebook guides you through the basics of loading a custom TXT and a PDF file externally into Pinecone as embeddings(vectors). 

It also guides you on the basics of querying your custom TXT/PDF file to get answers back (semantic search) from the Pinecone vector database, via the OpenAI LLM API. 

Using LLMs to query your own data is a powerful application to become operationally efficient for various tasks requiring looking up large documents.
